Delete Tuple Elements
Removing individual tuple elements is not possible. There is, of course, nothing wrong with
 putting together another tuple with the undesired elements discarded.

To explicitly remove an entire tuple, just use the del statement. For example −



"""


tup = ('physics', 'chemistry', 1997, 2000)
print (tup)
del (tup)
print ("After deleting tup : ")
print (tup)


"""

This produces the following result. Note an exception raised, this is because after del tup tuple does not exist any more −

('physics', 'chemistry', 1997, 2000)
After deleting tup :
Traceback (most recent call last):
   File "test.py", line 9, in <module>
      print tup;
NameError: name 'tup' is not defined

Basic Tuples Operations
Tuples respond to the + and * operators much like strings; they mean concatenation and repetition here too, except that the result is a new tuple, not a string.

In fact, tuples respond to all of the general sequence operations we used on strings in the prior chapter −

Python Expression	Results	Description
len((1, 2, 3))	3	Length
(1, 2, 3) + (4, 5, 6)	(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)	Concatenation
('Hi!',) * 4	('Hi!', 'Hi!', 'Hi!', 'Hi!')	Repetition
3 in (1, 2, 3)	True	Membership
for x in (1, 2, 3): print x,	1 2 3	Iteration"""
