Insertion Operation
Insert operation is to insert one or more data elements into an array. 
Based on the requirement, a new element can be added at the beginning, end, or any given index of array.

Here, we add a data element at the middle of the array using the python in-built insert() method.


"""


from array import *

array1 = array('i', [10,20,30,40,50])

array1.insert(1,60)

for x in array1:
 print(x)



"""

When we compile and execute the above program, it produces the following result which shows the element is inserted at index position 1.

Output

10
60
20
30
40
50
