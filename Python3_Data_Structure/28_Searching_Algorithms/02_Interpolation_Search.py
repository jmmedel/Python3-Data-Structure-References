Interpolation Search
This search algorithm works on the probing position of the required value.
 For this algorithm to work properly, the data collection should be in a sorted 
form and equally distributed. Initially, the probe position is the position of the
middle most item of the collection.If a match occurs, then the index of the item is returned.
If the middle item is greater than the item, then the probe position is again calculated in 
the sub-array to the right of the middle item. Otherwise, the item is searched in the subarray 
to the left of the middle item. This process continues on the sub-array as well until the size of subarray reduces to zero.

There is a specific formula to calculate the middle position which is indicated in the program below.
