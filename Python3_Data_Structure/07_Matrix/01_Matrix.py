Python - Matrix
Matrix is a special case of two dimensional array where each data element is of strictly same size. 
So every matrix is also a two dimensional array but not vice versa. Matrices are very important data 
structures for many mathematical and scientific calculations. As we have already discussed two dimnsional 
array data structure in the previous chapter we will be focusing on data structure operations specific to matrices in this chapter.

We also be using the numpy package for matrix data manipulation.

Matrix Example
Consider the case of recording temprature for 1 week measured in the morning, mid-day, 
evening and mid-night. It can be presented as a 7X5 matrix using an array and the reshape method available in numpy.

from numpy import * 
a = array([['Mon',18,20,22,17],['Tue',11,18,21,18],
		   ['Wed',15,21,20,19],['Thu',11,20,22,21],
		   ['Fri',18,17,23,22],['Sat',12,22,20,18],
		   ['Sun',13,15,19,16]])
    
m = reshape(a,(7,5))
print(m)

"""

The above data can be represented as a two dimensional array as below.

[['Mon' '18' '20' '22' '17']
 ['Tue' '11' '18' '21' '18']
 ['Wed' '15' '21' '20' '19']
 ['Thu' '11' '20' '22' '21']
 ['Fri' '18' '17' '23' '22']
 ['Sat' '12' '22' '20' '18']
 ['Sun' '13' '15' '19' '16']]
