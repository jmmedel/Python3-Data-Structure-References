Delete Dictionary Elements
You can either remove individual dictionary elements or clear the entire contents of a dictionary. 
You can also delete entire dictionary in a single operation. To explicitly remove an entire dictionary, just use the del statement. −


"""

dict = {'Name': 'Zara', 'Age': 7, 'Class': 'First'}
del dict['Name']; # remove entry with key 'Name'
dict.clear();     # remove all entries in dict
del dict ;        # delete entire dictionary

print ("dict['Age']: ", dict['Age'])
print ("dict['School']: ", dict['School'])


"""

This produces the following result. Note that an exception is raised because after del dict dictionary does not exist any more −

dict['Age']:
Traceback (most recent call last):
   File "test.py", line 8, in 
      print "dict['Age']: ", dict['Age'];
TypeError: 'type' object is unsubscriptable
