Python - Lists

The list is a most versatile datatype available in Python which can be
 written as a list of comma-separated values (items) between square brackets.
  Important thing about a list is that items in a list need not be of the same type.

Creating a list is as simple as putting different comma-separated values between square brackets. For example −

list1 = ['physics', 'chemistry', 1997, 2000];
list2 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ];
list3 = ["a", "b", "c", "d"]
Similar to string indices, list indices start at 0, and lists can be sliced, concatenated and so on.

Accessing Values in Lists
To access values in lists, use the square brackets for slicing along
 with the index or indices to obtain value available at that index. For example −

"""

list1 = ['physics', 'chemistry', 1997, 2000];
list2 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 ];
print ("list1[0]: ", list1[0])
print ("list2[1:5]: ", list2[1:5])


"""

When the above code is executed, it produces the following result −

list1[0]:  physics
list2[1:5]:  [2, 3, 4, 5]
