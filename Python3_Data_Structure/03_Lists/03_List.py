Delete List Elements
To remove a list element, you can use either the del statement if you know exactly which
 element(s) you are deleting or the remove() method if you do not know. For example −


"""

list1 = ['physics', 'chemistry', 1997, 2000];
print (list1)
del list1[2];
print ("After deleting value at index 2 : ")
print (list1)

"""

When the above code is executed, it produces following result −

['physics', 'chemistry', 1997, 2000]
After deleting value at index 2 :
['physics', 'chemistry', 2000]
Note − remove() method is discussed in subsequent section.

Basic List Operations
Lists respond to the + and * operators much like strings; they mean concatenation 
and repetition here too, except that the result is a new list, not a string.

In fact, lists respond to all of the general sequence operations we used on strings in the prior chapter.

Python Expression	Results	Description
len([1, 2, 3])	3	Length
[1, 2, 3] + [4, 5, 6]	[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]	Concatenation
['Hi!'] * 4	['Hi!', 'Hi!', 'Hi!', 'Hi!']	Repetition
3 in [1, 2, 3]	True	Membership
for x in [1, 2, 3]: print x,	1 2 3	Iteration
