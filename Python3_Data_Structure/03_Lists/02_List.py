Updating Lists
You can update single or multiple elements of lists by giving the slice on the left-hand side of the assignment operator, and you can add to elements in a list with the append() method. For example −


"""


list = ['physics', 'chemistry', 1997, 2000];
print ("Value available at index 2 : ")
print (list[2])
list[2] = 2001;
print ("New value available at index 2 : ")
print (list[2])

"""
Note − append() method is discussed in subsequent section.

When the above code is executed, it produces the following result −

Value available at index 2 :
1997
New value available at index 2 :
2001
